# Installation

There are several ways to install PyPDF2. The most common option is to use pip.

## pip

PyPDF2 requires Python 2.7+ to run, but [Python 2 is dead](https://pythonclock.org/).
Please use a recent version of Python 3 instead.

Typically Python comes with `pip`, a package installer. Using it you can
install PyPDF2:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

If you are not a super-user (a system adminstrator / root), you can also just
install PyPDF2 for your current user:

```bash
pip install --user PyPDF2
```

## Anaconda

Anaconda users can [install PyPDF2 via conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypdf2).


## Development Version

In case you want to use the current version under development:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2.git
```
